<h2>Engineering</h2>
Engineering is the application of scientific and mathematical principles to solve real-world problems by designing, building, and maintaining structures, machines, devices, systems, and processes.

It involves creatively using knowledge from science and math to invent, develop, and improve technology and infrastructure that benefit societyâ€”such as roads, buildings, vehicles, and medical devices. Engineers take ideas and turn them into useful solutions through innovation, design, and practical implementation, always considering safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.
